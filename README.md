# Stock Prediction

A machine learning project for stock price prediction using time series analysis.

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook implements a stock prediction model that analyzes historical stock data and makes predictions using machine learning techniques.

## Features

- Stock data analysis and visualization
- Time series data preprocessing
- Machine learning model for stock prediction
- Performance evaluation and visualization

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- (Add other libraries as needed)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Stock_Prediction.git
cd Stock_Prediction
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Stock_prediction.ipynb
```

Run the cells sequentially to:
1. Load and explore stock data
2. Preprocess the data
3. Train the prediction model
4. Visualize results
